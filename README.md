Project Description
This project involves analyzing a health dataset to uncover patterns and relationships that may indicate the presence of heart disease. The dataset contains information on various health metrics such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and heart rate, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.# Heart-Disease-Python-task1


Features
age: Age of the individual
sex: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
cp: Chest pain type (categorical)
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol: Serum cholesterol (in mg/dL)
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (1 = true, 0 = false)
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (categorical)
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
thal: Thalassemia (categorical)
target: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)


Objectives
Perform data exploration to understand the dataset structure and compute basic statistics.
Create visualizations to identify patterns and relationships between variables.
Draw insights about factors associated with heart disease.


Visualizations
Bar Chart: Distribution of categorical features like chest pain type.
Scatter Plot: Relationships between numerical features such as age and maximum heart rate.
Heatmap: Correlations among features to identify key predictors.
